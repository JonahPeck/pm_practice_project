# pm_practice_project
I want to build a practice project for product management

focuses from Matt - API integration, SQL, solving a problem, user feedback, iterating

NodeJs for backend framework - creating the API, SQL for the database of all the accounts - practicing both API integration/testing with Postman as well as SQL commands for database management - 

#next step is to create wire frame/outline of what the project will look like/operate under
#build backend funcitonality/connection to an API or database with all the accounts listed

#building out roadmap for developing tool 

#connecting with Amanda to get her input on using a tool like this
#would not be able to display accounts that only have showcase
#managed vs self op focus - find way to filter - annual account value = $0 if managed

#map view of pins of customers that can allow people to see what accounts we have and where. 

#google maps api for javascript with custom pins for schools, colleges and such

#node.js, google maps api, react frontend, sql database


#Next step - set up google maps api account stuff and walk through tutorial to get things working - mess around with it and from there get a better sense of best practices for building the application.
